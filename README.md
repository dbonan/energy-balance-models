# energy-balance-models

Code and data for various energy balance models (EBMs) accompanying a number of studies. 

The moist_EBM_perturbation_CMIP_output folder contains a moist EBM that is forced with CMIP output. More details can be found in:

The moist_EBM_mixed_layer folder contains a moist EBM coupled to surface ocean mixed layer with sea ice. A "q-flux" can be applied to simulate various ocean heat transport states by the ocean's overturning circulation.
